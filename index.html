            <p id = "aboutMe">Hello, and welcome to my website! A little bit about myself: Originally born in India, I spent the first few years of my life growing up in New Delhi. By the age of 7, I moved to Mumbai (a.k.a Bombay) where I spent the majority of my life. In 2013 I moved to Atlanta, Georgia and complted my high school before atteneding The University of Colorado at Boulder. I am currently a sophomore (2016) pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Outside of school, I have to lot of hobbies and interests that I like to spend my time on, including working on projects like this website. I also like to spend my time on Producing Music, 3D modelling (C4D), Photography, Digital Art, and Snowboarding. Considering that I spend a lot of time on these activities, I created this website to document and showcase my creations to my peers and employers.  </p>
